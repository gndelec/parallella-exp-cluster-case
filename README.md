## Assembly

![Completed PACK-02](/images/00-completedUnit.JPG)

1 Remove the protective plastic from the acrylic panels.The top come pre-assembled with fans, switch and XLR socket in place.

![Parallella and standoffs](/images/01-ParallellaAndStandoffs.JPG)

2 Start with a Parallella, 4x M3x5mm standoffs and 4x M3x5mm machine screws.

![Adding standoffs](/images/02-ParallellaWithStandoffsAttached.JPG)

3 Add the standoffs and screws as shown, and repeat for all Parallellas.

![Adding Porcupine](/images/03-PorcupineOnParallella.JPG)

4 Add the Porcupine breakout board, taking care that it is correctly oriented, and the high-density connectors are aligned before pushing together. Repeat for all Parallellas.

![Adding power cable](/images/04-powerCableOnParallella.JPG)

5 Add the main power cable to the first Parallella.

![Adding red jumper wire](/images/05-firstRedJumperWire.JPG)

6 Add the first red jumper wire as shown, between two Parallella boards. Take care to add to the correct threaded posts.

![Adding black jumper wire](/images/06-firstBlackJumperWire.JPG)

7 Add the first black jumper wire as shown, again taking care that to add it to the correct threaded posts.

![Adding M3 washers](/images/07-twoWashers.JPG)

8 Add 4x M3 washers to the first Parallella, 2 to each unoccupied post, to match up with those occupied by the ring terminals.

![Adding M3x20mm standoffs](/images/08-20mmStandoffs.JPG)

9 Add 4x M3x20mm standoffs to the first Parallella. Take care to note the orientation of the ring terminals, and that each standoff is sufficiently tight.

![Repeat for other Parallellas](/images/09-fourParallellas.JPG)

10 Repeat the last four steps until you have all of your Parallellas connected. Note that the last one only requires 1x M3 washer per unoccupied threaded post, since there is only one ring terminal on each occupied one.

![Adding short ribbon cables](/images/10-shortRibbonCables.JPG)

11 Add the short ribbon cables between the Parallellas as shown, taking care when adding them to the Porcupine boards. Note that these cables must be inserted the correct way around, due to a locating tab.

![Adding long ribbon cables](/images/11-longRibbonCables.JPG)

12 Add the long ribbon cables as shown, again taking care when pushing them in the Porcupine boards.

![Adding the adhesive feet to the base](/images/12-rubberFeet.JPG)

13 Turning attention to the base acrylic, add the 4x self-adheisve rubber bumpers, using the etched circles for alignment.

![Adding Parallellas to base](/images/13-boardsOnBase.JPG)

14 Add the Parallellas to the base, using 4x M3x12mm nylon machine screws per Parallella. Ensure that the boards are mounted as shown, with the base cutouts underneath the jumper pin headers.

![Cable routing](/images/14-cableRouting.JPG)

15 Take care to ensure that the cables are routed as shown, all inside the 20mm steel standoffs.

16 Use the small cable tie to secure the main power leads to the base acrylic.

17 Add the 4x M3 x 60mm standoffs to the base, one in each corner, using 4x M3 x 8mm machine screws.

![Adding top cover acrylic](/images/15-addingTop.JPG)
